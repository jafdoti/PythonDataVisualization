You are given two dictionaries:

plot_countries --- {'pr': "PuertoRico", 'no': 'Norway'}
gdp_countries --- { 'PRI': {dict containing country data for Puerto Rico}, 'NOR': {'dict containing country data for Norway } }

... and you also have one which you have created:

converter --- {'PR': 'PRI', 'NO': 'NOR' }

You must use these three to make a new dict consisting of the items in bold above (the respective dictionary keys):

WHERE:
key = plot_countries key
value = gdp_countries key
{'pr': 'PRI', 'no': 'NOR'}

... But there is one problem: the entries in 'converter' can be in any case: {'Pr': 'prI', 'nO': 'NOr' }, or {'pR': 'Pri', 'no': 'NOR' } , or any other combination.

Figure out a way to do it using only the two-entry dictionaries I've shown here. It should work with any of the 'converter' variations.

Once you have that, you can worry about the empty set.
